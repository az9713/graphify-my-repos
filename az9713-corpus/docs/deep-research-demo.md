# deep-research-demo
# Deep Research, Showcased — From a Persuasive Talk to a Verified Investment View

A worked, end-to-end example of the **`/deep-research` multi-agent harness** (Claude Code): how to turn a vague but compelling talk into a **fact-checked, valuation-aware investment view** — with the method's own limitations honestly labeled.

The source is Dan Dreyfus's critical-minerals / commodity-supercycle presentation (All-In). Two `/deep-research` runs verified the thesis, *corrected* the source, priced the opportunities, and — just as importantly — **refused to certify the data it couldn't corroborate.**

**▶ Live walkthrough (GitHub Pages):** **https://az9713.github.io/deep-research-demo/** — the `deep-research-harness.js` engine, rendered line-by-line in the browser.

## What `/deep-research` is (in one diagram)

```

        ┌──────────── Run 2: "Is the price right?" ───────────┐
        │  5 phases · 109 agents · 27 sources · 123 claims     │
        │  → 22/25 (3 refuted, 5 names uncovered)              │

```

Each run = **Scope → Search → Fetch → Verify → Synthesize**. The agent budget breaks down as `1 + 5 + 27 + 75 + 1 = 109`, with **~69% of agents (75 of 109) spent *trying to disprove* the findings** before any reach the report.

## Headline findings

**Run 1 — thesis (25/25 claims verified):**
- ✅ Copper, rare-earth-processing, grid-equipment, and uranium bottlenecks are **real and primary-sourced**.
- ⚠️ Two of Dreyfus's headline numbers **don't verify** (the "50,000 t/GW" copper figure; the silver "3 years left").
- 🔁 **"Silver = solar" is backwards** — PV silver demand is *falling* (−19%); the deficit is investment-led.
- 🚨 **Highest-value catch:** China's rare-earth controls are **SUSPENDED until ~Nov 2026** — a fact the talk never mentioned.

**Run 2 — valuation (the margin-of-safety check):**
- The **best-thesis names are the worst-value entries.** PWR (~95x P/E), GEV (~70x EV/EBITDA), ETN (~60% above 10-yr avg) are **priced for perfection**; **FCX** (~8x) and **FSLR** offer real margin of safety.
- The engine **refused to certify** 3 conflicting price claims and left **5 of 10 names unranked** — failing loudly instead of fabricating.

**Best risk-adjusted entries (verified names):** FCX → FSLR → ETN → GEV → PWR.

## The method lesson

`/deep-research` is a **truth filter** — only as good as how stably "true" the data is.

| Question type | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Durable facts** (use it) | forecasts, laws, filings, fundamentals | Run 1: **25/25 verified** |
| **Live values** (don't) | today's price, current P/E | Run 2: **3 refuted, 5 names uncovered** |

Use it when *being wrong is expensive* and *the truth is spread across many sources that disagree*. For live single-source numbers, look them up directly and feed them in.

## Reproduce it yourself

1. Provide your own source(s) — a transcript, PDF, article, or URL.
2. Adapt [`investment_opportunity_prompt.md`](investment_opportunity_prompt.md) to your domain.
3. In Claude Code, run `/deep-research` pointed at the brief (pin your universe/horizon/constraints).
4. Chain a second pass for whatever Run 1 leaves open (here: valuation).
5. Trust the "verified" label *because* the engine refuses to certify what it can't corroborate.

See [DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md](DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md) for the full reusable pattern.
