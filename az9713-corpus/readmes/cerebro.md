# Personal OS - Your Intelligent Content Consumption System

Personal OS is a powerful **content consumption automation system** that helps you **consume, analyze, and remember** content from across the internet. Whether you're watching YouTube videos, reading articles, studying research papers, or listening to podcasts, Personal OS creates structured summaries and insights that you can reference forever.

## What Does Personal OS Do?

Imagine having a personal assistant that:
- **Watches YouTube videos** and extracts the key insights so you don't have to rewatch
- **Reads articles** and summarizes the main points
- **Analyzes research papers** and explains them in plain English
- **Transcribes podcasts** and pulls out actionable takeaways
- **Generates flashcards** for spaced repetition learning
- **Creates weekly digests** of everything you've consumed
- **Exports to Obsidian/Notion** for your personal knowledge base
- **Monitors RSS feeds** and auto-queues new content

That's Personal OS.

## Who Is This For?

- **Lifelong learners** who consume lots of content but forget what they learned
- **Researchers** who need to process many papers quickly
- **Content creators** who need to stay on top of trends
- **Students** studying from video lectures and online resources
- **Professionals** who want to learn efficiently

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites

You need these installed on your computer:

1. **Python 3.10 or higher** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Node.js 18 or higher** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **Claude Code CLI** - [Install Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
4. **yt-dlp** (for YouTube): `pip install yt-dlp`

### Step 1: Get an API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" and create a new key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### Step 2: Set Up the Project

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd /path/to/personal-os

# Set up the backend
cd web/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Three Ways to Use Personal OS

### 1. Slash Commands (Explicit)

Type a command directly for precise control:

```bash
/yt https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123
/read https://example.com/article
/arxiv https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345
```

### 2. Skills (Natural Language)

Just describe what you want in plain English:

```
"Analyze this YouTube video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc"
"Summarize this blog post for me"
"What did I read this week?"
```

### 3. Web Interface

Use the graphical dashboard at http://localhost:3000 for:
- Visual content submission
- Browsing reports with search
- Viewing activity logs
- Dark mode support

---

## Example Output

When you run `/yt https://youtube.com/watch?v=example`, you get a structured report:

```markdown
# How to Build Better Habits

## Understanding the Prompt System

### Why Enhanced Prompts?

The analysis prompts were designed with two goals:

1. **Maximum Breadth** - Extract ALL significant information, not just top 5-7 points
2. **Maximum Depth** - Capture specifics (numbers, names, quotes) not just summaries

Each prompt includes **12-14 comprehensive sections** that ensure no valuable information is lost.

### Latent Signals

Every prompt includes a **Latent Signals** section that surfaces implied insights:

- **Unstated assumptions** - What does the creator take for granted?
- **Implied predictions** - What future trends are suggested?
- **Hidden motivations** - Why is this being shared now?
- **Second-order effects** - What downstream consequences follow?

### Customizing Prompts

1. Open the appropriate file in `prompts/`
2. Add, remove, or modify sections
3. Save - changes take effect immediately

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "yt-dlp not found" | Run `pip install yt-dlp` |
| "No captions available" | Enable audio transcription with OPENAI_API_KEY |
| "WebFetch failed" | Save content to `inbox/` and use `/analyze` |
| Command not recognized | Restart Claude Code |
| Report not saved | Check that `reports/` folders exist |
| Report not in web UI | Click "Sync Reports" in sidebar or wait 30 seconds |

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for complete solutions.
