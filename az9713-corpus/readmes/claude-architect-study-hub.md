## Study Aids & Their Effectiveness

This package includes 12 types of study materials, each designed to reinforce learning through a different modality. Research consistently shows that **multi-modal study** (combining reading, active recall, hands-on practice, and spaced repetition) produces significantly better retention than any single approach.

### 1. Interactive Syllabus Hub (`index.html`)
**Effectiveness: Navigation & Progress Tracking**

Your home base. Opens in any browser — no server needed. Mirrors the exact exam syllabus structure with clickable links to every material. Tracks which materials you've visited and which task statements you've marked complete. Includes three ready-made study plans (1-week, 3-day, 1-day crash course).

> *Why it works*: Reduces cognitive overhead. You never waste time wondering "what should I study next?" — the hub tells you exactly where you are and what's left.

---

### 2. Deep-Dive Study Notes (5 files)
**Effectiveness: Conceptual Understanding**
**Location:** `study-notes/`

One comprehensive file per domain. Each task statement section includes:
- **"What You Need to Know"** — knowledge requirements mapped from the official syllabus
- **"What You Need to Be Able to Do"** — skills requirements with code examples
- **"Deep Dive"** — 3-5 paragraphs with Python, JSON, and CLI examples
- **"Exam Tip"** — how the topic typically appears in exam questions
- **"Anti-Pattern Alert"** — wrong approaches that show up as distractors
- **"Cross-Domain Connection"** — links to related topics in other domains

> *Why it works*: The exam tests *architectural judgment*, not memorization. These notes build the mental models needed to reason through tradeoff questions — the dominant question type on the exam.

---

### 3. Quick Reference Cheat Sheets (5 files)
**Effectiveness: Rapid Review & Pattern Recognition**
**Location:** `cheat-sheets/`

One condensed page per domain with key concepts tables, decision matrices, config snippet references, anti-pattern lists, and "if you remember nothing else" critical facts.

> *Why it works*: Perfect for the 48 hours before the exam. Decision matrices (e.g., "hooks vs prompts," "batch vs sync API") map directly to common exam question patterns where you must choose between two valid-sounding approaches.

---

### 4. Domain Quizzes (5 HTML files, ~56 questions)
**Effectiveness: Active Recall & Gap Identification**
**Location:** `quizzes/`

10-15 questions per domain with immediate feedback. Each question includes:
- Difficulty rating (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Task statement tag
- Detailed explanation for *every* option (why correct is correct, why each distractor fails)
- Score tracking with retry and shuffle

> *Why it works*: Active recall (testing yourself) is 2-3x more effective than re-reading. The per-domain format lets you identify weak areas before investing time in full mock exams. Distractor explanations train the elimination skills needed for the real exam.

---

### 5. Full Mock Exams (3 HTML files, 150 questions)
**Effectiveness: Exam Simulation & Stamina Building**
**Location:** `mock-exams/`

Each mock exam replicates the real exam experience:
- **~50 questions** across 4 scenarios (different scenario mix per exam)
- **90-minute configurable timer** with visual urgency warnings
- **Question navigator** with flag-for-review
- **Score dashboard** with per-domain breakdown, weakness heatmap, pass/fail projection against the 720/1000 threshold
- **Review mode** and **retry-incorrect mode**

| Mock Exam | Scenarios | Best Used |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Mock A** | S1, S2, S3, S5 | First attempt — baseline assessment |
| **Mock B** | S1, S3, S4, S6 | After studying — measure improvement |
| **Mock C** | S2, S4, S5, S6 | Final readiness check |

> *Why it works*: The #1 predictor of exam success is practice under exam conditions. The timer builds pacing instincts. The weakness heatmap tells you exactly which task statements to revisit. Three exams with zero question overlap ensure you're tested on breadth, not memorization.

---

### 6. Scenario Workbooks (6 files, 30 questions)
**Effectiveness: Applied Reasoning in Context**
**Location:** `scenario-workbooks/`

One workbook per exam scenario. Each contains the scenario context, a mapping of which task statements are most relevant, 5 practice questions with full explanations, a guided walkthrough solving a realistic problem, and a hands-on exercise.

> *Why it works*: The real exam presents questions *within scenarios*. Practicing questions in their scenario context builds the contextual reasoning the exam requires — you learn to recognize which domain concepts apply to which real-world situations.

---

### 7. Flashcards App (1 HTML file, 120+ cards)
**Effectiveness: Spaced Repetition & Long-Term Retention**
**Location:** `flashcards/`

Interactive flashcard app with:
- 3D flip animation
- "Got It" / "Need Review" sorting
- Domain filter tabs with per-domain progress bars
- Streak tracking and accuracy stats
- **localStorage persistence** — progress survives between sessions
- "Weak Cards" mode focuses on cards you've marked for review
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space=flip, G=got it, R=review)

> *Why it works*: Spaced repetition is the most efficient memorization technique known. The "weak cards" mode automatically focuses your time on what you don't know yet. 15 minutes per day for a week is more effective than 2 hours of cramming.

---

### 8. Hands-On Lab Guides (2 files, 15 exercises)
**Effectiveness: Muscle Memory & Practical Confidence**
**Location:** `labs/`

- **Claude Code CLI Lab** (10 exercises): CLAUDE.md hierarchy, path-specific rules, custom skills, MCP configuration, plan mode, CI/CD mode, session management, built-in tools
- **Agent SDK Lab** (5 exercises): Agentic loops, tool calling, hooks, subagents, error handling

Each lab includes prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, expected output, and exam-relevance notes.

> *Why it works*: Domain 3 (Claude Code, 20%) and Domain 1 (Agentic Architecture, 27%) are best learned by doing. Hands-on experience makes configuration questions feel like recall rather than reasoning — faster and more accurate on exam day.

---

### 9. Interactive Session Scripts (6 files)
**Effectiveness: Multi-Surface Practice**
**Location:** `interactive-sessions/`

Guided conversation scripts for different Claude surfaces:

| Session | Surface | Task Statements |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Prompt Engineering | Claude.ai (web) | 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 |
| Structured Output | Claude.ai (web) | 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 |
| Agentic Loop | Claude Code CLI | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 |
| MCP Configuration | Claude Code CLI | 2.4, 3.1, 3.2 |
| Code Review Pipeline | Cowork | 3.6, 4.1, 4.6 |
| Mobile Review | Claude mobile app | All domains |

> *Why it works*: Following a guided script with exact prompts to type removes the "blank page" anxiety of hands-on practice. Checkpoint questions after each step verify understanding before moving on.

---

### 10. Visual Infographics (5 HTML files)
**Effectiveness: Spatial Memory & Quick Comprehension**
**Location:** `infographics/`

Professional SVG diagrams covering:
- Agentic loop lifecycle & hub-and-spoke architecture
- MCP architecture (transport types, scoping, tools vs resources)
- Claude Code configuration hierarchy (CLAUDE.md, rules, skills, commands)
- Decision trees (plan mode, batch API, decomposition strategy)
- Error handling taxonomy & escalation flow

> *Why it works*: Complex architectures are easier to remember as images than as text. The decision trees map directly to exam questions that ask "which approach should you use?"

---

### 11. Interactive Concept Map (1 HTML file)
**Effectiveness: Cross-Domain Relationship Understanding**
**Location:** `concept-map/`

Force-layout graph with 36 nodes showing how all 5 domains and 30 task statements connect. Cross-domain links are labeled. Scenario overlay buttons highlight which nodes each scenario tests. Click any node for a summary tooltip.

> *Why it works*: Exam questions frequently span multiple domains. Understanding connections (e.g., hooks in D1 relate to error handling in D2 and escalation in D5) helps you recognize the "right" answer when options come from different domains.

---

### 12. Bonus Exam Strategy Materials (5 files)
**Effectiveness: Test-Taking Skills & Confidence**
**Location:** `bonus/`

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Exam Day Strategy** | Time management, question reading technique, elimination strategy, 720/1000 threshold insight |
| **Common Traps & Pitfalls** | 5 distractor patterns decoded from sample questions (Over-Engineering, Wrong Problem, Insufficient Guarantee, Premature Optimization, Wrong Scope) |
| **Pro Tips by Domain** | 35 insider tips (7 per domain) — the most testable facts distilled to single sentences |
| **Wrong Answer Trainer** (HTML) | Interactive exercise: identify WHY each wrong answer is wrong. 30 exercises, tracks accuracy by trap type |
| **30-Min Power Review** | The ~50 most testable facts on one page — for the morning of the exam |

> *Why it works*: On a multiple-choice exam, eliminating wrong answers is often faster than identifying the right one. The traps guide teaches you to spot the 5 patterns that account for most distractors. The power review is your last-minute confidence boost.

## How This Package Was Built

This isn't a hastily assembled collection — it was systematically engineered. See [`preparation-process.md`](preparation-process.md) for complete transparency into:

- **13 official sources** fetched and analyzed (exam guide, Claude Code docs, skills spec, changelog)
- **Gap analysis** confirming 100% coverage of all 30 task statements
- **5-agent team** that produced all materials in parallel:
  - `domain1-notes` (Opus) — Domain 1 deep-dive (highest-weighted domain)
  - `notes-writer` (Sonnet) — Domains 2-5 notes, cheat sheets, bonus materials, study guide
  - `scenario-writer` (Sonnet) — Scenario workbooks, labs, interactive sessions, flashcards
  - `html-builder` (Sonnet) — Quizzes, infographics, concept map
  - `exam-builder` (Sonnet) — Mock exams, wrong-answer trainer
- **Quality assurance**: Every task statement appears in 3+ artifact types

---

## How the Materials Were Revised

After initial generation, all 47+ study artifacts underwent a rigorous revision process guided by three principles:

### 1. Section-by-section syllabus alignment

Every piece of content was audited against the [official exam guide](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F8lsy243ftffjjy1cx9lm3o2bw%2Fpublic%2F1773274827%2FClaude+Certified+Architect+%E2%80%93+Foundations+Certification+Exam+Guide.pdf)'s 27 task statements across 5 domains. Each task statement's "Knowledge of" and "Skills in" bullets became a checklist. Materials that missed a task statement were updated; content outside the exam scope was removed.

### 2. Concepts and decision logic over code

The exam is multiple-choice and tests architectural judgment — not coding ability. The original study notes were 45–70% code blocks (3,300+ lines of Python/JSON). These were replaced with:

- **Decision tables** — "When X, use Y because Z" (the dominant exam question pattern)
- **Comparison matrices** — hooks vs prompts, plan mode vs direct execution, batch vs sync API
- **Anti-pattern explanations** — why each wrong answer fails, not just what the right answer is
- **Conceptual pattern descriptions** — what a pattern does and when to choose it

Code was retained only as short pseudocode (≤15 lines) where the structure itself is the tested concept (e.g., the agentic loop skeleton with `stop_reason` checks).

### 3. Substantiated by official Anthropic documentation

Every factual claim was verified against these official sources:

| Source | What it provided |
|--------|-----------------|
| [Claude Code Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview.md) | CLAUDE.md hierarchy, hooks, skills, MCP, subagents, CLI flags, plan mode |
| [Claude Code Docs Index](https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt) | Complete documentation structure and cross-references |
| [Memory & CLAUDE.md](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory.md) | 4-level hierarchy, @import syntax, auto memory, /memory command, 200-line guidance |
| [Hooks Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md) | PreToolUse/PostToolUse events, exit code 2 blocking, settings.json configuration, matcher patterns |
| [Skills Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md) | Frontmatter fields (context:fork, allowed-tools, disable-model-invocation, user-invocable), scope hierarchy, commands merged into skills |
| [Subagents Documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md) | Built-in types (Explore/Haiku, Plan, general-purpose), AgentDefinition fields, no-nesting constraint, foreground vs background |
| [MCP Integration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp.md) | Project vs user scope, ${ENV_VAR} expansion, MCP resources vs tools, tool search |
| [Headless / Agent SDK CLI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless.md) | -p flag, --output-format json, --json-schema, --bare mode, --allowedTools, --append-system-prompt |
| [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) | Open standard for SKILL.md format, frontmatter fields, directory structure |
| [Claude Code Changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) | Task tool → Agent tool rename (v2.1.63), feature evolution |

Key accuracy corrections made during revision:
- `PreToolCall` → `PreToolUse` (official hook event name)
- CLAUDE.md is loaded as **user messages**, not system prompt
- CLAUDE.md content **survives `/compact`** (re-read from disk)
- Subagents **cannot spawn other subagents** (no nesting)
- Explore subagent uses **Haiku** model for cost efficiency
- Added missing CLI flags: `--bare`, `--allowedTools`, `--append-system-prompt`, `--continue`
- Added missing skill properties: `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`
