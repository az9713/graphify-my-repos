## How This Was Built

This game was developed through **human-AI collaboration**:

- **Human**: Creative direction and steering only
- **Claude Code**: Wrote all code, designed architecture, sourced assets, tested via browser automation
- **Claude in Chrome**: Visual testing and gameplay verification

Inspired by **Chong-U -- AI Oriented Dev**'s tutorial:
[Ditch Unity: How I Vibe Code 3D Games With AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu7NZ3t3sLM&t=659s)
