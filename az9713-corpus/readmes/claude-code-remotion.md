## What is This Project?

This project lets you create videos using code instead of video editing software. Think of it like programming a movie - you write React components that describe what should appear on screen, and Remotion converts that into a real video file.

**Output Example**: A 7-second animated intro with the "Claude Code" logo, spring animations, glowing effects, and a tech aesthetic.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18 or higher** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **A code editor** - VS Code recommended

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project folder
cd claude_remotion_me2

# 2. Install dependencies (only needed once)
npm install

# 3. Start the preview studio
npm run dev

# 4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

You'll see Remotion Studio where you can preview and scrub through the video.

### Render the Video

```bash
npx remotion render ClaudeCodeIntro out/claude-code-intro.mp4
```

This creates the final video file in the `out/` folder.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Why We Use It |

| Remotion | Video framework | Creates videos from React code |
| React | UI library | Component-based, declarative |
| TypeScript | Language | Type safety, better tooling |
| Node.js | Runtime | Runs JavaScript outside browser |

## For C/C++/Java Developers

If you're coming from traditional programming:

- **React components** are like classes that render UI
- **JSX** (the HTML-like syntax) compiles to function calls
- **Props** are like constructor parameters
- **Hooks** (`useState`, `useCurrentFrame`) are like instance variables
- **npm** is like Maven/Gradle/CMake for JavaScript

See [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for detailed explanations.
