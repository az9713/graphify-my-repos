# Agentic Judge Layer

A full implementation of Nate Jones's LLM-as-Judge architecture, built on top of Mihail Eric's minimal coding agent. The project starts with a ~150-line agent harness and ends with a three-file, 34-feature judge layer that enforces authorization, risk policy, memory governance, and human escalation — all validated by an automated test suite that runs 34 tests in under 3 minutes.

---

## Origin: Mihail Eric's Coding Agent

The foundation is [Mihail Eric's coding agent from scratch](https://www.mihaileric.com/The-Emperor-Has-No-Clothes/) ([source on Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YtpKFVG13DHyQ2i3HOtwyVJOV90nWeL2/view)).

That agent is intentionally minimal — a pure demonstration of the actor pattern:

- A `gpt-4o` actor with a simple system prompt and three tools: `read_file`, `list_files`, `edit_file`
- A tool registry built from Python function signatures and docstrings using `inspect`
- A REPL loop: `input()` → actor LLM call → parse tool line → execute tool → append `tool_result` → repeat
- No judgment, no policy, no safety rails of any kind

```
User prompt
    ↓
Actor (gpt-4o) — "tool: edit_file({...})"
    ↓
Execute immediately
    ↓
Append result to conversation
```

This is the "Emperor Has No Clothes" moment: the agent is capable, but there is nothing between the actor's decision and the filesystem. A vague instruction, a misunderstood scope, a blind overwrite — all execute without any check. Mihail's post makes the argument that this gap is the core problem with agentic AI systems.

## The Judge Layer: Nate Jones's Architecture

[Nate Jones's judge-layer work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX1myuPEDFg) defines a production-grade control plane for agentic systems. The central idea is that the actor and the judge are separate roles with separate optimization targets:

> "The actor optimizes for task completion. The judge optimizes for authorization, policy, correctness, privacy, and risk. They can use the same model family, but they shouldn't be the same role."

We implemented all 34 features from Nate's architecture across three files:

| File | Role | Lines |
|------|------|-------|
| `coding_agent_with_judge.py` | Actor loop, tool execution, proposal construction, judge dispatch, metrics | ~664 |
| `judge_memory.py` | Decision log, recall, provenance, use policies, review queue, memory inspector | ~436 |
| `judge_specialists.py` | Auth specialist, risk specialist, composition rules, checks object | ~286 |

## Architecture

```
User prompt
    ↓
Actor (gpt-4o) — proposes tool call
    ↓
classify_action() — read_only? skip judge immediately
    ↓
build_action_proposal() — mechanical, no LLM
  ├── risk_class (read_only / reversible_write / high_risk)
  ├── risk_flags (outside_workspace, blind_overwrite, overwrites_existing)
  └── sensitivity (contains_secret_like_data)
    ↓
recall_prior_decisions() — up to 5 relevant prior decisions from log
    ↓
[auth-judge]  run_authorization_judge()    [risk-judge]  run_risk_judge()
  o4-mini, reasoning_effort=low              o4-mini, reasoning_effort=low
  → PASS / FAIL / UNCERTAIN + confidence     → PASS / FAIL / UNCERTAIN + confidence
    ↓
compose_specialist_verdicts() — 6 ordered composition rules
  → ALLOW / BLOCK / REVISE / ESCALATE + checks + confidence
    ↓
Enforce decision:
  ALLOW    → execute tool, write log
  BLOCK    → synthetic error result, write log
  REVISE   → append guidance to conversation, actor retries (max 2)
  ESCALATE → prompt human [y/N] + optional note, write log + review queue
    ↓
High-risk override: run_command always escalates regardless of verdict
    ↓
write_decision_log() → judge_decisions.jsonl
```

## The 34 Features

### Part 1 — Core Judge Layer

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Action Classification** | `RISK_CLASS` dict maps every tool to a tier; `classify_action()` drives dispatch. Read-only tools skip the judge entirely. |
| 2 | **Structured Action Proposal** | `build_action_proposal()` mechanically constructs a proposal dict before any judge call — no LLM. Prevents the actor from winning by writing persuasive prose. |
| 3 | **Separate Actor and Judge Models** | `gpt-4o` for task completion; `o4-mini` for each specialist. Three separate LLM calls per judged action. |
| 4 | **ALLOW** | Both specialists PASS at medium/high confidence → tool executes. Green banner. |
| 5 | **BLOCK** | Risk FAIL (workspace violation, sensitivity) or auth FAIL with no fixable path → tool never executes. Red banner. |
| 6 | **REVISE** | Auth FAIL with a `revision_hint` → guidance appended to conversation; actor retries with corrected call. |
| 7 | **ESCALATE** | Either specialist UNCERTAIN, low confidence, or high-risk tool → human approval prompt `[y/N]` + optional note. |
| 8 | **Workspace Boundary Enforcement** | `is_relative_to(WORKSPACE)` check is deterministic in `build_action_proposal()`. The risk specialist treats `outside_workspace=True` as absolute FAIL — no LLM reasoning can override it. |
| 9 | **Blind Overwrite Detection** | `old_str == ""` sets `blind_overwrite=True`. Auth specialist checks whether the user explicitly authorized a full rewrite. |
| 10 | **REVISE Loop with Max-Revision Protection** | Revision counter resets per turn; stops at `MAX_REVISIONS = 2` with a warning. Prevents infinite loops. |
| 11 | **Fail-Closed on Judge Error** | Any specialist exception returns `UNCERTAIN`; two UNCERTAINs compose to ESCALATE. Never falls back to ALLOW silently. |
| 12 | **Decision Log / Write-Back** | Every judged action appends one JSONL line to `judge_decisions.jsonl` with 18+ fields including event_id, confidence, checks, use_policy, provenance. |
| 13 | **Provenance Labels (7-Status Set)** | `observed`, `user_confirmed`, `generated`, `inferred`, `superseded`, `disputed`, `imported`. Recall filters to `{observed, user_confirmed}` only. |
| 14 | **Judge Recall from Prior Decisions** | Before each judge call, up to 5 recent relevant decisions (same file prioritized) are injected into the auth specialist's context. |
| 15 | **Session Metrics** | Per-session counters (ALLOW/BLOCK/REVISE/ESCALATE, per-risk-class breakdown, escalation rate, revision rate, human approvals, duration) printed on exit. |

### Part 2 — Risk Classification and High-Risk Tools

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 16 | **Formal 4-Tier Classification** | `read_only` → `reversible_write` → `high_risk`; tier shown in cyan banner on every tool call. |
| 17 | **`run_command` Tool** | Shell command execution via `subprocess.run`. Always shows `[tool:high_risk]` in the banner. |
| 18 | **High-Risk Always-Escalates** | If `risk_class == "high_risk"` and the composed verdict is ALLOW, it is overridden to ESCALATE. The judge provides reasoning; the human makes the final call. |

### Part 3 — Specialist Judges

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 19 | **Authorization Specialist** | Evaluates only whether the user explicitly authorized this action (scope, recency, instruction clarity). Returns PASS/FAIL/UNCERTAIN + confidence + optional `revision_hint`. |
| 20 | **Risk Specialist** | Evaluates only technical risk signals: workspace boundary, blind overwrite, sensitivity flags, command safety. Deterministic flags from the proposal constrain LLM reasoning. |
| 21 | **Composition Logic (6 Rules)** | 1. Risk FAIL → BLOCK  2. Auth FAIL + hint → REVISE  3. Auth FAIL + no hint → BLOCK  4. Either UNCERTAIN → ESCALATE  5. Both PASS but low confidence → ESCALATE  6. Both PASS + medium/high → ALLOW |
| 22 | **Confidence Scoring** | Each specialist returns `high/medium/low`. Composition takes the minimum. Low confidence → automatic escalation (Rule 5). |
| 23 | **`checks` Object** | `{authorization_check, risk_check, sensitivity_check, policy_check}` per decision. Stored in log, displayed in banner, testable in eval suites. |

### Part 4 — Memory Governance

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 24 | **Memory Use Policies** | `can_use_as_evidence` (default), `requires_confirmation` (approved ESCALATE), `can_use_as_instruction` (human-confirmed in review queue). Labels shown in recall context. |
| 25 | **Full 7-Status Provenance Set** | See Feature 13. All statuses wired to real actions (mark_entry_superseded, mark_entry_disputed, process_review_item). |
| 26 | **Review Queue with Instruction-Grade Gating** | Approved ESCALATEs and REVISE outcomes enqueue lesson candidates to `judge_review_queue.jsonl`. Nothing becomes `can_use_as_instruction` without explicit `[c]onfirm` in the review CLI. |
| 27 | **Review Queue CLI** | `--review` mode: interactive loop showing pending items with `[c]onfirm [e]dit [d]owngrade [r]eject [D]ispute [s]kip` actions. |
| 28 | **Memory Inspector CLI** | `--inspect` prints all log entries (newest first) with decision, confidence, checks, provenance, use_policy. Filterable by filename or session ID. |
| 29 | **`mark_entry_superseded` / `mark_entry_disputed`** | Rewrite JSONL in-place; superseded/disputed entries are excluded from future recall. |
| 30 | **Human Correction Feedback** | After `[y/N]` escalation prompt, an optional note is captured and stored in the log entry and review queue item. |

### Part 5 — Policy, Rate Budgets, Sensitivity

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 31 | **Policy Versioning** | `JUDGE_POLICY_VERSION = "v1.0"` stamped on every log entry. Past decisions preserve the version that governed them. |
| 32 | **Rate Budget Warnings** | Live terminal warnings when escalation rate > 30% or revision rate > 25%. `ESCALATION_RATE_WARN`, `REVISION_RATE_WARN` constants. |
| 33 | **Sensitivity Detection** | Deterministic regex scan of `old_str`/`new_str` for API key patterns (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `eyJ`), credential assignments (`API_KEY = "..."`), and long numeric strings. Sets `contains_secret_like_data=True` → risk specialist returns FAIL immediately. |
| 34 | **Startup Banner** | Prints actor model, judge model, workspace path, and policy version on session start. Makes the control-plane configuration visible and auditable. |

## Security Layers in Detail

The judge layer defends against four categories of agentic failure:

### 1. Scope Creep (Authorization)

The authorization specialist asks: *did the user actually authorize this specific action?* It checks instruction scope, recency, and whether the actor is extending a prior instruction beyond its intended boundary.

The most common form is **blind overwrite**: gpt-4o often sends `old_str=""` (replace the entire file) when the user asked to change one line. `build_action_proposal()` sets `blind_overwrite=True` deterministically; the auth specialist flags scope creep.

```
User: "change the return value of foo to 2"
Actor: edit_file(path="demo.py", old_str="", new_str="<entire rewritten file>")
Auth: FAIL — actor replacing whole file; user only asked to change one return value
→ REVISE: "Use targeted old_str/new_str that replaces only 'return 1' with 'return 2'"
```

### 2. Workspace Violations (Risk)

`build_action_proposal()` calls `path.is_relative_to(WORKSPACE)` before any LLM call. If false, `outside_workspace=True` is set in the proposal. The risk specialist system prompt treats this as an **absolute FAIL** with no exceptions — no LLM reasoning can override a deterministic workspace boundary check.

```
User: "edit C:\Windows\system32\hosts"
Risk: FAIL (high) — outside_workspace=true. Absolute policy: no writes outside workspace.
→ BLOCK
```

### 3. Sensitive Data Injection (Sensitivity)

Regex patterns scan `new_str` before the judge call. If a secret-like pattern matches, `contains_secret_like_data=True` is set. The risk specialist treats this as FAIL regardless of other factors.

Patterns include:
- OpenAI/GitHub/JWT key prefixes: `sk-`, `pk-`, `ghp_`, `eyJ`
- Credential assignments: `API_KEY = "..."`, `password = "..."`, `token = "..."`
- Long numeric strings (card-like patterns)

```
User: 'add the line: API_KEY = "sk-abc123..."'
Sensitivity scan: contains_secret_like_data=True
Risk: FAIL — sensitive pattern detected in proposed change
→ BLOCK: file unchanged
```

### 4. Unverifiable Commands (High-Risk Override)

`run_command` executes arbitrary shell commands. Even if both specialists return PASS, the runtime overrides to ESCALATE — a human must approve every shell command. The judge provides reasoning; the human makes the final call.

```
User: "run the command: echo hello"
Judge specialists: PASS (benign echo)
High-risk override: ALLOW → ESCALATE
→ Human prompt: "Approve this action? [y/N]:"
```

### Fail-Closed Design

Every failure mode degrades safely:
- Judge API error → UNCERTAIN → ESCALATE (never silently ALLOW)
- Unrecognized tool → `"unknown"` risk class → synthetic error result
- Max revisions exceeded → break with warning, no silent loop
- stdin EOF → clean exit with session metrics

---

## Testing Journey

### Phase 1: Manual Testing (TESTING.md)

We wrote `TESTING.md` with 43 numbered tests across five parts, each specifying:
- Which features it covers and the Nate concept it maps to
- Prerequisites (e.g., specific `demo.py` content)
- Exact prompt to type
- Expected terminal output in a code block
- Pass/fail criteria

Running all 43 manually takes 20–30 minutes and produces results that can't be diffed or archived.

### Phase 2: Automated Testing (run_tests.py)

`run_tests.py` implements a **two-tier test architecture**:

#### Tier 1 — Unit Tests (24 tests, ~1 second, no API calls)

The unit tests import the application modules directly and test all deterministic logic:

```python
import coding_agent_with_judge as agent
import judge_memory
from judge_specialists import compose_specialist_verdicts
```

Every test that touches the filesystem uses `unittest.mock.patch` to redirect to a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, keeping real log files clean and enabling parallel runs:

```python
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
    tmp_path = Path(tmp)
    with patch.object(judge_memory, "LOG_FILE", tmp_path / "test_log.jsonl"):
        judge_memory.write_decision_log(...)
        # assert against tmp_path, never the real log
```

Each test builds an `evidence` list of assertion values that appears verbatim in `test_results.md`, so a reader can verify the pass without re-running.

#### Tier 2 — Integration Tests (10 tests, ~60 seconds, ~15 LLM calls)

Integration tests automate the interactive agent REPL by piping all expected inputs through `subprocess.stdin`:

```python
def _run_agent(inputs: List[str], timeout: int = 120) -> Tuple[int, str]:
    stdin_text = "\n".join(inputs) + "\n"
    r = subprocess.run(
        [sys.executable, "-X", "utf8", "coding_agent_with_judge.py"],
        input=stdin_text,
        capture_output=True,
        text=True,
        encoding="utf-8",
        errors="replace",
        timeout=timeout,
        cwd=str(PROJECT_DIR),
        env={**os.environ, "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8", "PYTHONUTF8": "1"},
    )
    return r.returncode, (r.stdout or "") + (r.stderr or "")
```

The agent consumes `input()` calls in a known sequence per turn:

```
input("You: ")              ← user prompt
[actor + specialist LLM calls]
input("Approve? [y/N]: ")   ← only for ESCALATE
input("Note: ")             ← only if approved
input("You: ")              ← next turn OR EOF → exit
```

Prompts are written to force immediate tool calls rather than conversational preamble:

```python
# Fragile — actor may ask questions, consuming inputs out of order
"make demo.py production-ready"

# Robust — actor calls edit_file immediately
"call edit_file on demo.py with old_str='' and new_str='x=1'"
```

Output is matched with `re.search()` against patterns like `r"\[JUDGE: ALLOW\]"`. Evidence is extracted by scanning captured output for judge-relevant keyword lines.

### Bug Found by the Tests

During the first unit test run, `[1.14b/14] recall: same-path entries prioritized` failed:

```
AssertionError: same-path entry e3 missing from recalled: ['e1', 'e2', 'e4']
```

**Root cause:** `recall_prior_decisions()` used `(same + other)[-max_items:]`. With `same = [e3]` and `other = [e0, e1, e2, e4]`, the combined list `[e3, e0, e1, e2, e4]` has 5 elements. `[-3:]` returns `[e1, e2, e4]` — dropping `e3` entirely. Same-path entries were silently excluded when there were enough other-path entries to fill the window.

**Fix:**
```python
n_same = min(len(same), max_items)
n_other = max_items - n_same
selected = same[-n_same:] + (other[-n_other:] if n_other > 0 else [])
return sorted(selected, key=lambda e: e.get("timestamp", ""))
```

Without the test, this bug would have silently degraded judge quality by excluding prior decisions about the file being evaluated.
