# Codex Browser Use Demo

This repository documents a small Codex browser automation workflow: identify a product from a local photo, find the matching Amazon item, add quantity 1 to the shopping cart, and stop before checkout.

The demo is intentionally written as an audit trail rather than an app. The main artifact is the process report:

- [Amazon cart automation report](./amazon_cart_process_report_2026-05-02.md)

## What This Demonstrates

- Using local image tooling to inspect an uploaded product photo.
- Recovering when a `.JPG` file is actually HEIC data.
- Running `browser-use[cli]` through `uvx` without a permanent install.
- Driving Amazon through visible browser automation with `open`, `state`, and `click`.
- Verifying that the cart contains exactly one item.
- Avoiding checkout and payment actions.

## Tech Stack

- PowerShell for command orchestration.
- ImageMagick for image identification, conversion, and cropping.
- `uvx` with Python 3.13 for temporary CLI execution.
- Browser Use CLI (`browser-use`) for browser automation.
- Amazon.com web UI as the target browser surface.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repository creation and push.

## Browser Use CLI

`browser-use[cli]` exposes the `browser-use` command. Its core workflow is:

```powershell
browser-use open https://example.com
browser-use state
browser-use click 5
```

The useful part for agent workflows is `state`: it returns visible/clickable page elements with numeric indices. The agent can inspect the page, choose the right index, click it, and re-run `state` after the page changes.

Browser Use is open source and licensed under MIT:

## Safety Notes

The committed images in `assets/` are metadata-stripped copies for documentation. The original local photo and generated scratch crops are not committed.

The automation stopped at the shopping cart. It did not open or submit checkout.
