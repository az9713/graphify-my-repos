# BigIDE: Agent Orchestration IDE

> A desktop application for orchestrating AI coding agents across multiple projects — with git worktree isolation, terminals, task boards, code review, embedded browser preview, governance controls, GitHub PR/merge workflow, and auto-generated session reports built in.

### Inspiration

This project was inspired by two key ideas in the AI-assisted development space:

- **Theo Browne's video ["We need a bigger IDE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMDnaMIpoGo)** — arguing that agentic coding demands a new kind of IDE that wraps all your projects in a spatial, zoomable workspace with embedded browsers, terminals, and agent orchestration.
- **Addy Osmani's article ["The IDE Is Being De-Centered"](https://addyosmani.com/blog/the-ide-is-being-de-centered/)** — arguing that the center of gravity is shifting from the text editor to orchestration dashboards and control planes, with task boards, worktree isolation, and governance as core primitives.

BigIDE is an attempt to combine both visions into a working prototype. For a detailed comparison of how the current implementation aligns with and diverges from these visions, see [docs/VISION_COMPARISON.md](docs/VISION_COMPARISON.md).

## What is BigIDE?

BigIDE is a desktop application built with **Electron** (a framework that lets you build desktop apps using web technologies) and **React** (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces). It gives you a single workspace where you can run, monitor, and control multiple AI coding agents — such as Gemini CLI, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or GitHub Copilot — working across several projects at the same time.

Think of it as a mission control panel for AI-assisted software development. Instead of switching between browser tabs, terminals, and code editors, BigIDE brings everything into one place:

- Launch an agent in a sandboxed Git worktree (an isolated copy of the repository).
- Watch its terminal output in real time.
- Review the code changes it produces as a diff.
- Approve or reject actions through a governance system before they are committed.
- Create pull requests directly from the IDE.
- Track work items on a Kanban-style task board.

If you have experience with C, C++, or Java but are new to web or Electron development, the key thing to understand is that Electron apps have two separate execution environments that communicate over a message-passing interface (called IPC):

1. **Main process** — runs as a normal Node.js process, has full OS access (spawning terminals, reading files, calling Git).
2. **Renderer process** — runs inside a sandboxed Chromium (browser) instance, displays the UI.
3. **Preload script** — a trusted bridge that selectively exposes main-process capabilities to the renderer.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Multi-project canvas | Visual overview of all projects and tasks using a node-based canvas (React Flow) |
| Kanban task board | Create, assign, and track tasks through Todo / Running / Needs Review / Done / Error columns |
| Embedded terminal | Full xterm.js terminal with real PTY — clipboard support (Ctrl+C/V/A), right-click word select, auto-focus |
| Terminal tabs | Terminal tabs persist for running, needs-review, and error tasks; hidden not unmounted on tab switch |
| Code diff viewer | Unified diff view of every file changed by an agent (react-diff-view); auto-commits agent work on review |
| Governance / approval system | Intercept and approve or deny agent actions before they modify the repository |
| Git worktree isolation | Each task runs in its own Git worktree; auto-detects default branch; auto git init for new folders |
| Pull request creation | Create GitHub PRs via Octokit; auto-creates repo with `gh repo create`; shows PR URL on task card |
| Session reports | Auto-generated self-contained HTML report per task; saved to `.bigide-reports/`; cyan Report button |
| Real-time output parsing | Heuristic regex pipeline with 3-second startup grace period; strips ANSI from terminal output lines |
| Notification system | In-app notifications for task state changes, errors, and approvals needed |
| Browser panel | Embedded iframe backed by a local HTTP file server; auto-serves worktree on tab switch |
| Agent summary panel | Auto-generated Markdown summary of completed work; diff stats; tool activity grouped by type |
| Tool log panel | Structured timeline of every tool call made by the agent (file reads, writes, shell commands) |
| Persistent state | Project and task data is saved to disk between sessions (electron-store); stale tasks reset on restart |

## Prerequisites

Before you can run or build BigIDE, make sure the following are installed on your machine.

### 1. Node.js 18 or later

Node.js is the JavaScript runtime that powers both Electron's main process and the build tooling. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). The LTS (Long Term Support) release is recommended.

Verify your installation:

```bash
node --version   # should print v18.x.x or higher
npm --version    # npm comes bundled with Node.js
```

### 2. Git

Git must be available on your `PATH` because BigIDE shells out to the `git` binary at runtime (via simple-git) for worktree management and diff generation.

```bash
git --version
```

### 3. Python 3.x and C++ build tools (for node-pty)

`node-pty` is a **native Node.js addon** — it contains C++ code that is compiled against your local Node.js and OS headers. This is similar to a JNI library in Java.

**Windows:**
```bash
npm install --global windows-build-tools
# or install "Desktop development with C++" from Visual Studio Installer
# Python is included with the above, or install from python.org
```

**macOS:**
```bash
xcode-select --install   # installs Clang and build tools
# Python 3 ships with macOS 12+
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential python3
```

### 4. An AI agent CLI (at least one)

BigIDE launches agents as subprocess commands. The **default model is Gemini CLI**. Install at least one:

- **Gemini CLI** (default) — `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` (then `gemini`)
- **Claude Code** — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (then `claude`)
- **OpenAI Codex** — `npm install -g @openai/codex` (then `codex`)
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — install via `gh extension install github/gh-copilot` (then `gh copilot`)

Verify the agent command is on your `PATH`:
```bash
gemini --version
# or
claude --version
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bigide.git
cd bigide
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will also run the `postinstall` script which rebuilds `node-pty` against your installed version of Electron (native addons must be compiled specifically for the Electron Node.js version, not the system Node.js version).

If `postinstall` fails, you can rebuild manually:

```bash
npx electron-rebuild -f -w node-pty
```

### 3. Start in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command:
1. Starts the Vite dev server for the renderer (React UI) with hot-module replacement.
2. Compiles and watches the main process TypeScript.
3. Launches Electron, which opens the app window.

Changes to renderer code appear instantly without restarting. Changes to main-process code require a restart (press `Ctrl+R` in the app or re-run `npm run dev`).

### 4. The app opens

You should see the BigIDE window with:
- A left sidebar for navigation.
- A main canvas view showing your projects.
- A bottom panel area for terminals, diffs, and logs.

If the window does not open, check the terminal output for errors. The most common first-run issues are a missing native rebuild for `node-pty` or a missing AI agent binary.

## Building for Production

To package BigIDE as a standalone desktop application:

### Step 1: Build the TypeScript and bundle the assets

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles all TypeScript and bundles the renderer into `dist/`.

### Step 2: Package with electron-builder

```bash
npx electron-builder
```

electron-builder reads `electron-builder.yml` and produces a platform-specific installer or package:

| Platform | Output |
|---|---|
| Windows | `dist/release/BigIDE Setup x.x.x.exe` (NSIS installer) |
| macOS | `dist/release/BigIDE-x.x.x.dmg` |
| Linux | `dist/release/BigIDE-x.x.x.AppImage` |

To build for a specific platform explicitly:

```bash
npx electron-builder --win
npx electron-builder --mac
npx electron-builder --linux
```

> Note: Building for macOS requires running on a Mac (Apple code-signing and notarization are macOS-only processes).

## Architecture Overview

Understanding how the three Electron processes fit together helps when debugging or extending BigIDE.

```

**Data flow for launching an agent:**

1. The user clicks "Run Agent" in the React UI (renderer).
2. The `useIpc` hook calls `window.electronAPI.launchAgent(taskId, agentName)`.
3. The preload script forwards this as an IPC message to the main process.
4. `ipc-handlers.ts` receives the message and calls `agent-launcher.ts`.
5. `agent-launcher.ts` spawns the agent CLI inside a `node-pty` PTY.
6. PTY output is streamed back to the renderer via IPC events and rendered by xterm.js.
7. Simultaneously, `output-parser.ts` watches the same stream for structured JSON events (tool calls, state changes) and updates the task store and tool log.

**Zustand stores** hold all UI state and act as a local cache of data received from the main process. Any component can subscribe to a store slice and will re-render automatically when that slice changes — no prop drilling needed.
