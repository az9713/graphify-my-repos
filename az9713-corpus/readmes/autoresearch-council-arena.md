# AutoResearch Council Arena

**4 AIs compete to write the best argument for why they should exist. The best version survives.**

An autonomous writing optimizer that combines two frameworks by Andrej Karpathy:

- **[autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch)** — greedy hill-climbing experiment loop (commit → evaluate → keep/discard → repeat forever)
- **[llm-council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council)** — multi-model consensus pipeline (parallel proposals → anonymous ranking → chairman synthesis)

The demo topic — *"Autoresearch + LLM Council is the simplest, cheapest way to achieve recursive self-intelligence"* — is itself proof of concept: the system is continuously improving the argument for its own existence.

> **Status: early development.** This project has not been extensively tested. Expect rough edges, especially around Windows path handling, port conflicts, and OpenRouter model availability. Contributions and bug reports welcome.

## Experiment: 48 Iterations in the Wild

We ran the system for **48 real iterations** on a live tutorial-writing task — a step-by-step guide on building a minimal LLM evaluation loop in Python. The council improved the tutorial autonomously from a deliberately weak starting draft, with no human intervention between iterations.

*Snapshot of the final round — iteration 49, best score 96/100, all five scoring dimensions near ceiling:*

![Final round — Stage 3 Chairman's Verdict, iteration 49, score 96/100](docs/final_round.jpg)

**Highlights:**
- **48 iterations**, 3 KEEPs, best score **96/100** — run self-terminated via plateau detection (10 consecutive DISCARDs)
- Mid-run network outage (iterations 12–22) recovered automatically; the loop continued without intervention
- Sub-score breakdown (Correctness / Completeness / Clarity / Code Quality / Depth) tracked per iteration — all five dimensions reached 17–19/20 at termination
- Council models consistently ranked new proposals above the baseline yet the chairman scored them lower — revealing a **score anchoring problem** that led to the multi-dimensional scoring redesign
- Total cost: **~$0.30** for 11 substantive pre-outage iterations (~$0.028/iteration)

**Post-mortem and analysis:**

**Auto-generated at runtime:**

| File | Committed | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `events.jsonl` | No | Append-only log within a run — stage events (evaluate.py) + run/iteration events (run.py); cleared on each restart |
| `run.log` | No | Human-readable terminal output from the last `bash start.sh`; overwritten each restart |
| `winning_proposal.md` | No | Latest winning proposal (read by `run.py` on KEEP) |
| `critique.md` | **Yes** | Chairman critique — committed on KEEP and fed back into Stage 1 next iteration |
| `results.tsv` | No | Full iteration log (commit, score, status, timestamp) |

---

## Configuration

### `.env`

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

### `config.py` — Key Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `COUNCIL_MODELS` | 4 models (see below) | Proposers and evaluators |
| `CHAIRMAN_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | Stage 3 judge (must not be in COUNCIL_MODELS) |
| `IMPROVEMENT_THRESHOLD` | `2` | Minimum score delta to KEEP |
| `EXPERIMENT_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Wall-clock budget per iteration (seconds) |
| `MAX_ARTIFACT_WORDS` | `3000` | Hard cap — proposals over this fall back to E |
| `PLATEAU_WINDOW` | `10` | Consecutive DISCARDs before plateau warning |
| `COST_LIMIT_USD` | `5.00` | Stop when this much has been spent (set in `.env`, blank = no limit) |

### Model Selection

The four council models are chosen for diversity across reasoning axes:

| Letter | Model | Axis |
|--------|-------|------|
| A | `openai/gpt-5.4-nano` | Analytical / structured reasoning |
| B | `anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku` | Creative / nuanced prose |
| C | `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` | Fast / broad knowledge |
| D | `x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta` | Contrarian / reasoning |
| Chairman | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | Stage 3 judge (conflict-free) |

Swap any model by editing `COUNCIL_MODELS` in `config.py` — no other changes needed. All models must be valid [OpenRouter slugs](https://openrouter.ai/models).

### Customizing the Topic

Edit `program.md` to change what the system optimizes. It defines the topic, target audience, evaluation criteria, constraints, and exploration directions. This is the **only human control point** during a run — edit it between iterations to steer the optimization or break a plateau.

## Live Dashboard

The React frontend auto-switches tabs as each stage completes:

| Tab | Shows |
|-----|-------|
| **Artifact** | Current `artifact.md` with expandable previous version |
| **Stage 1 · Proposals** | All four proposals with model labels and word counts |
| **Stage 2 · Rankings** | Aggregate rankings with "street cred" bar visualization |
| **Stage 3 · Verdict** | WINNER, COUNCIL_SCORE dial, KEEP/DISCARD status, critique |

The left sidebar shows iteration count, best score, KEEP/DISCARD totals, word count, and a score-over-time line chart.

---

## Cost

| Component | Calls/iteration | Estimated cost |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Stage 1 — 4 proposals (A/B/C/D) | 4 | ~$0.008 |
| Stage 2 — 4 anonymous rankings | 4 | ~$0.010 |
| Stage 3 — 1 chairman judgment | 1 | ~$0.001 |
| **Total** | **9** | **~$0.019** |

Claude Haiku (council B) is the most expensive model in the lineup — it dominates Stage 1 and Stage 2 costs. The default `COST_LIMIT_USD = 5.00` gives ~260 iterations. Cost is tracked in real time via OpenRouter's credits API — no estimating.

## Verification

```bash
# Evaluate.py works standalone (one iteration, no loop)
uv run python evaluate.py
# Expected output includes: "council_score: XX" and "winner: X"

# Stage 1 parallelism — should complete in ~8s, not ~32s
time uv run python evaluate.py 2>&1 | grep "Stage 1 complete"

# Git discipline — only KEEP iterations produce commits
git log --oneline

# Three-file discipline — evaluate.py has 1 commit, artifact.md has many
git log --follow evaluate.py
git log --follow artifact.md
```
